# Overview

This project provides a webhook controller for integrating GitHub events with bot functionalities, primarily focused on generating documentation from commands in issue comments or pull request actions. The controller listens for specific GitHub events and processes user commands, automating tasks like commenting on issues, checking permissions, and creating documentation based on user instructions. It targets developers who want to enhance their workflow with automated documentation generation.

# Development Setup

Ensure you have the necessary files and dependencies set up in your project. This may include:

- **Node.js**: Installed environment.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure you install required libraries specified in the `package.json`.

# Function/Class Documentation

## RouteWebhookRequest

- **Purpose**: 
    - Handles incoming webhook requests from GitHub, processes events related to issues and pull requests, and responds based on the commands issued by users.
  
- **Parameters**:
    - `req`: The HTTP request object from GitHub containing header and body details of the event.
    - `res`: The HTTP response object used to return results back to the GitHub service.
    
- **Return Type**: This function does not return a value but sends HTTP responses.

- **Inline Comments**:
    - Handles different event types (issues, pull requests).
    - Ignores requests originating from the bot itself to prevent recursion.
    - Comments on issues based on the command format parsed from the issue comment body.

- **Snippet**:
    ```javascript
    export const RouteWebhookRequest = async (req, res) => {
        const event = req?.headers["x-github-event"];
        const action = req?.body?.action;
        ...
    };
    ```

## generateDocumentation

- **Purpose**: 
    - Responsible for generating documentation based on the user's input command. It retrieves content, creates a commit, and notifies the user about the process status.
  
- **Parameters**:
    - `req`: The HTTP request object from GitHub.
    - `octokitClient`: Client instance to interact with GitHub's API.
    - `owner`: The repository owner's username.
    - `repoName`: The name of the repository.
    - `safePath`: A sanitized path where documentation will be updated.
    
- **Return Type**: This function does not return a value but performs asynchronous operations to handle documentation tasks.

- **Inline Comments**:
    - Begins by notifying the user that the bot has started working.
    - Calls an LLM (likely a Language Model) to get the content for documentation.
    - Creates a commit with the newly generated documentation content and notifies the user upon completion.

- **Snippet**:
    ```javascript
    const generateDocumentation = async (req, octokitClient, owner, repoName, safePath) => {
        await commentOnIssue(req, octokitClient);
        ...
    };
    ```

# Dependencies

- **parserUtils.js**: Provides utility functions for parsing requests and retrieving markdown content.
    - Functions: `getMarkdownContent`, `parseRequest`.
  
- **githubUtils.js**: Contains functions for interacting with GitHub API.
    - Functions: `commentOnIssue`, `detectMergePR`, `createCommit`, `checkPermissions`.

- **comments.js**: Constants for message responses used throughout the webhook.
    - Constants: `invalidCommandFormat`, `invalidPermissions`, `generationSuccess`.

- **botNames.js**: Contains bot-related constants used for command recognition.
    - Constants: `botName`, `APP_NAME`.

- **helpers.js**: Provides helper functions for command formatting.
    - Functions: `checkCommandFormat`, `formatPath`.

# Notes

- The webhook controller is dependent on several external utility files to handle various operations; these are assumed to be correctly implemented in `utils` and `constants` directories.
- The function `checkCommandFormat` is used to ensure that the user's command follows the expected structure before processing further.
- Error handling is included to manage common situations, such as bad command formats or permission issues.
- The command verification and response generation are tailored for interactive use, primarily aiming at user experiences in GitHub repositories.
